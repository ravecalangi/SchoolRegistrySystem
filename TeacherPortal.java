                                     What is a Parrot?
                                     A parrot is a colorful bird known for its ability to mimic sounds and human speech.
                                     Parrots are intelligent, social animals often kept as pets and found in warm climates.
                                     
                                     Why Learn About Parrots?
                                     Learning about parrots helps us understand more about bird behavior, communication, and the environment they live in.
                                     Parrots are fascinating creatures with unique traits that make them special among birds.
                                     
                                     Example:
                                     
                                     A parrot can repeat words you say.
                                     
                                     It can have bright feathers like green, red, or blue.
                                     
                                     It can live in the wild or in your home as a pet.
                                     
                                     Knowing about parrots helps us appreciate nature and take better care of animals.
